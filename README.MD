# Overview

Redfin coding challenge

# Install
This coding sample makes use of two libraries: `net/http` and `json`. The former is included as part of the base Ruby distribution, while `json` may not be available by default.

To install `json`:
`sudo gem install json`

Then ensure that `show_open_food_trucks.rb` and `food_truck_run.rb` are copied into the same folder.

# Run
To run the food truck coding sample, issue this command:

 `ruby food_truck_run.rb`
